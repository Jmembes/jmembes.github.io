A Silly Technological Instrument (STI) is a problem with a mathematical instrument such as a calcator which is either a problem with the instrument or a problem with the user.

These are not to be confused with Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) which are infections transmitted via sexual activity.

There are many types of STIs, each affecting different aspects of the instrument or user.

## Highly Inaccurate Values
Highly Inaccurate Values (HIV) is an STI that changes the answer from the expected answer to something innacurate. 

### Causes
The #1 cause of HIV is speedily inputing numbers in your instrument. If you don't look carefully at the numbers you input, this may affect you.

This may also be caused by putting the entire equation into your instrument at once. 

### Cures
Carefully reading over the equation before you press the equals button.

## Low Quality Instrument
Low Quality Instrument (LQI) is an STI that causes your instrument to be very simple.

### Symptoms
Some symptoms of LQI are:
- Calculator not having advanced functions.
- Absence of Trig Functions.
- Confusing input styles.

### Causes
Not investing in a high quality scientific calculator is the sole cause of LQI.

### Cures
Investing in a high quality scientific calculator.

## Radians Instead of Degrees
Radians Instead of Degrees (RID) is a common STI that only affects angles. 

### Symptoms
Some symptoms of RID are:
- Trig functions giving different answers.
- Failing the `tan 45` test.

### Causes
Changing the angle mode to Radians or Gradians.

### Cures
Changing the angle mode to Degrees (D, Â°)
