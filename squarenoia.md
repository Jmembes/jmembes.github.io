Squarenoia is a disease that leads to a misunderstanding of what happens when you square a polynomial.

This disease starts to show in grade 10-11 math.

## Symptoms
Some of the symptoms of Squarenoia are:
- Getting wrong answers when squaring polynomials.
- Failing the `(x + 2)²` test

What you might answer would be `x² + 4`, while the correct answer is `x² + 4x + 4`.

## Causes
The main cause is not listening to your teacher while teaching polynomial multiplication, or not understanding how squaring works.

## Treatment
To overcome squarenoia, you can follow along.

How to properly solve `(x + 2)²`:<br>
1. Square the first term. `x²`
2. Multiply the two terms twice and add them together. `x² + 2x + 2x` -> `x² + 4x`
3. Square the last term. `x² + 4x + 4`

Now we have the correct answer.
