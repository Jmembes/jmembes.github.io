Squarenoia is a disease that leads to a misunderstanding of what happens when you square a polynomial.

This disease starts to show in grade 10-11 math.

## Symptoms
Some of the symptoms of Squarenoia are:
- Getting wrong answers when squaring polynomials.
- Failing the $(x + 2)^2$ test

What you might answer would be $x^2 + 4$, while the correct answer is $x^2 + 4x + 4$.

## Causes
The main cause is not listening to your teacher while teaching polynomial multiplication, or not understanding how squaring works.

## Treatment
To overcome squarenoia, you can follow along.

How to properly solve $(x + 2)^2$:<br>
1. Square the first term. $x^2$
2. Multiply the two terms twice and add them together. $x^2 + 2x + 2x$ -> $x^2 + 4x$
3. Square the last term. $x^2 + 4x + 4$

Now we have the correct answer.
