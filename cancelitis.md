Cancelitis is a disease that affects your understanding of when you can cancel things in fractions.

This disease usually starts to be more prevelent during grades 9, 10 and 11.

## Symptoms
Some symptoms of Cancelitis are:
- Fractional answers may be wrong.
- Equations may not work.

To see if you have it, try to solve $2a(5x) \over 2a + 5x$.

## Causes
A major cause of Cancelitis is not paying attention to your teacher during class.

This could be caused by using your mobile device to use social media apps during class time.

## Treatment
In fractions, you can't always find a clean answer.

However, you can cancel $5x$ in the expression $2a^2(5x) \over 2a(5x)$.<br>
1. $2a^2 \over 2a$
2. $a^2 \over a$
3. $a$

Now we have the correct answer.
